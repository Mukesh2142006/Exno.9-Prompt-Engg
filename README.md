## Aim: 
To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Video Generation
## 1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has made it possible to generate high-quality videos from simple text prompts. Modern video generation models can interpret descriptions, create scenes, animate characters, control lighting, and simulate camera movements.
This experiment uses three leading AI video generation tools—Sora, Runway Gen-2, and Invideo AI—to understand how different models respond to the same prompt and how their outputs vary in quality, realism, and accuracy.

## 2. Overview of the Tools
### 2.1 Sora

Sora is an advanced AI text-to-video model capable of generating highly realistic, photorealistic videos. It is designed to understand complex prompts, simulate physics, handle motion, and maintain consistency across frames.
It is currently considered one of the most powerful video generation models.

#### Use Cases

- Cinematic video generation

- Realistic simulations

- Creative filmmaking and pre-visualization

- Advertisement and concept design

- Storyboarding

#### Advantages

- Exceptional realism and detail

- Smooth and natural motion

- Strong understanding of prompt structure

- Can handle complex scenes, multiple characters, and dynamic lighting

#### Disadvantages

- Limited public availability

- High computational cost

- Occasional inaccuracies with fine details

- Sometimes over-interprets prompts

### 2.2 Runway Gen-2

Runway Gen-2 is a popular AI video generator known for its creative flexibility. It supports text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing through generative AI.
It is widely used by creators, marketers, and designers.

#### Use Cases

- Creative animations

- Short film concepts

- AI art videos

- Stylized or cinematic scenes

- Experimental content

#### Advantages

- Easy to use

- Several generation modes (text, image, video)

- Strong artistic and cinematic output

- Good for creative freedom and stylization

#### Disadvantages

- Less realistic than Sora

- Occasional glitches or distortions

- Motion may not always be smooth

- Some features require a paid plan

### 2.3 Invideo AI

Invideo AI is an AI-based video creation platform focused on script-to-video generation.
Unlike Sora and Runway, which generate scenes entirely from scratch, Invideo often uses stock footage, templates, and AI-generated clips to assemble a finished video.

#### Use Cases

- YouTube videos

- Educational/explainer videos

- Marketing content

- Social media content

- Script-based video creation

#### Advantages

- Very easy for beginners

- Good for long-form content (1–10 minutes)

- Includes voiceovers, subtitles, templates

- Fast generation

#### Disadvantages

- Less control over scene realism

- More template-based output

- Motion and camera dynamics are limited

- May not closely match highly detailed prompts

## 3. Experiment: Video Generation Using 3 Tools

### 3.3 Invideo AI Video Generation
#### Prompt Used:
```
Create a minute long sequence of b-roll shots about a dense jungle on an alien world, with bizarre, glowing flora and tall, twisting trees. Strange creatures flying, jumping and walking in the jungle. they can be seen moving through the thick foliage.
```
#### Generated Video:

## 5. Overall Analysis

- Sora provides the highest realism and best motion handling.

- Runway is more artistic and creative, good for imaginative prompts.

- Invideo is best for scripted videos and beginner-friendly content.

- Each tool reacts differently to prompt complexity.

- Prompt design plays a major role in shaping the output.

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how different AI video tools interpret the same prompt in unique ways.
Sora focuses on realism, Runway focuses on creativity, and Invideo focuses on structured content.
Understanding each model's strengths helps in selecting the right tool for the right task.
